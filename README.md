This site is running on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

To use Jekyll, you'll need to first install Ruby. More info on [Jekyll's installation page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Once Ruby is installed, you should be able to locally run this Jekyll site. To run locally, first clone or download this website. In terminal, `cd` into this website's folder. Then run `bundle exec jekyll serve`. The site should now be running on `http://localhost:4000/interviews/`.
